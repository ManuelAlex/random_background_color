# Random RGB Background Color Generator App 

This Flutter application displays the text **"Hello there"** in the middle of the screen.  
When the user taps anywhere on the screen, the background color changes to a randomly generated color.  
The app can generate **16,777,216 unique colors** using RGB values.

This is my submission for a test task.
This application was tested on a macos and have not been test on other
flutter supported devices yet.
